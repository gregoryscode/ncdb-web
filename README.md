**NCDB Web** (Night Crows Database) is an Angular-based web application designed to centralize and organize comprehensive information about the game *Night Crows*. It serves as a companion tool for players, offering a detailed and searchable database of:

- 🗺️ Quests  
- 🎒 Items  
- 🐎 Mounts  
- 📘 Guides  
- 📊 And more game-related content  

Whether you're a new player or a veteran crow, NCDB aims to help you navigate and master your journey.

<h3>Project status</h3>

This project was abandoned before it even got off the ground.
Like many WEMADE games, Night Crows slowly turned into a money pit 💸 — and so did my motivation to build a companion app for it. NCDB remains here as a reminder of good intentions... and bad gacha decisions.
